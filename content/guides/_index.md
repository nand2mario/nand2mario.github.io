FPGA are great devices for tinkerers. If you are interested in electronics design, computing and retro games, come join the fun. Here are some projects and modules I created for helping with your FPGA projects.

## Memory
* [SDRAM controller for Tang Nano 20K](https://github.com/nand2mario/sdram-tang-nano-20k) - A simple SDRAM controller with example code.
* [DDR3 controller for Tang Primer 20K](https://github.com/nand2mario/ddr3-tang-primer-20k) - A DDR3 controller for Tang Primer 20K, used in NESTang 0.4. DDR memory is much more complex than SDRAM. Make sure you try SDRAM before you tackle DDR.

## Interfaces
* [SNES gamepad module](https://github.com/nand2mario/snes_controller_tang_primer_25k) - This is a quick demo of reading the SNES controller with Verilog (Tang Primer 25K).
* [Usb_hid_host](https://github.com/nand2mario/usb_hid_host) - An easy-to-use USB mouse, keyboard and gamepad interface implemented completely in Verilog, with examples for Tang Nano 20K, Primer 25K, IceBreaker, IceSugar-Pro and other boards.
