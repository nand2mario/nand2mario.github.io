Happy New Year! The site has a fresh new design. I’ve replaced Hugo with a minimal, custom static site generator that suits my needs much better.

Another update: comments have moved from Disqus to [Giscus](https://giscus.app/). While Disqus was once a decent platform, it has become overwhelmed with ads. Giscus, on the other hand, uses GitHub Discussions as the backend—meaning no ads, just straightforward commenting, which fits a technical blog well.

Giscus will be the commenting system here for the foreseeable future.
